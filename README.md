# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game for the Odin Project curriculum. You can play both with a friend and an AI ranging from easy to impossible.

What I gained:
- Knowledge of factory functions, IIFE's, and modules in javascript.
- How to create an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI using the minimax algorithm.
- A better understanding of scope and namespace.
- Experience with creating an interactive display.
